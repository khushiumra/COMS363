COM S 363 - Introduction to Database Management Systems

This is a course that is an introduction to Database design using entity-relationship model, data dependencies, and object definition language. In this course, I learned
about relation, object-oriented, and semi-structured data models and queries, by adhering to SQL, ODMG, and XML standards. I also learned about application development
in SQL-like languages and general purpose host languages with application program interfaces, and information integration using data warehouses, mediators, and wrappers.

This course consisted of four homeworks, and three programming projects, that were distributed throughout the course with individual submissions.
